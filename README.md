# Bundle App

## Work in progress - tune in later for more
This app is being updated with features piece by piece. Check in later for more!

### Introduction
This app will aggregate media content from several sources and bundle them up into a single page app.
The purpose of this app is to make a single home page for users to check daily. 
It removes the chore of navigating to the users fav. sites just to see if something new has been posted.
In the future users will have the ability to add/remove media channels.
