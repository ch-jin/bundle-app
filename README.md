## Introduction
This app aggregates media content from several sources and bundles them up into a single page app.

**Currently supporting: Youtube, Reddit, and Twitch**

This app provides a new home page for people who want all of their daily content streamlined to them on one site! It removes the chore of having to manually navigate to your favorite site just to check to see if new content has been posted.
